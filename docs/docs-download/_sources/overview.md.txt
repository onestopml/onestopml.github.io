Data is the most important thing for training & fine-tuning machine learning models. Poor quality of data
can make models perform worse. Moreover, understanding model prediction errors helps
model developers improve accuracy significantly. Jupyter Labs/Notebooks are common
tools for research to analyze and investigate model performance. However, these tools
are not designed for these tasks, making time-consuming and inefficient. 

Renex is a right tool for us to visualize and explore our data. This helps data scientists/engineers
boost their model performance. Also, Renex is fully integrated with annotation service,
helping continuous data improvement pipelines run smoothly with a single click.
