# Core Concepts
<p id="readtime"></p>
These following terms are our core concepts. Although we know data scientists/engineers
are familiar with these concepts. However, we would like to revise to make our 
user manual complete and clear.

## Datasets
A dataset contains main samples. Each sample contains annotations and predictions. 
Each user can have multiple datasets and manage permission for each dataset. There 
are two ways to work with datasets. One is to use our web application with rich user experience. To access user's 
datasets, click the menu "datasets" as shown in [Figure 1a](#fig1). 
Another is to use our SDK/CLI (refer to [this](sdkcli/datasets/index.html))
## Workspaces 
Workspace is a place for users to view a datasets. In there, we support a lot of visual tools to help users
do analysis as quick as possible. Like datasets, we support two ways to work with: via web application
and via SDK/CLI. To access user's workspace on the web application, 
click the menu "workspaces" as shown in [Figure 1b](#fig1).
