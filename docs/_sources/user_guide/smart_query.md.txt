# Smart Query
With smart query, we have a lot of advanced ways to filter and select samples in our dataset.

1. Query Bar
   
   To query samples with some specific conditions, go to "Query bar" (as shown in [Figure 1a](#fig1)) and type some query conditions in Renex query format. The "Query bar" are integrated with autocomplete feature which suggests relevant query strings as shown in [Figure 1b](#fig1)

   <div class="scalize" id="fig1">
   <img src="../_static/img/smart_query.jpg" class="target">
   <div class="item-point" data-top="33" data-left="15"><div><a href="#" class="toggle">a</a></div></div>
   <div class="item-point" data-top="70" data-left="18"><div><a href="#" class="toggle">b</a></div></div>
   <div class="caption"><span>Figure 1. Renex query bar</span> <a class="headerlink" href="#fig1" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p></div>
   </div>

2. Instruction for typing query string

   Query string can be typed manually with the support of auto-suggestion feature. 
  
   For example, type first few characters of sample field and choose suggestion by “Up/Down” key or click left mouse on the correct suggestion. After choose suggestion, press next keyword to go to next suggestion. When finish query string, press “Enter” 

   In order to make system work as expected, the query string must have “empty space” between each term in query sentence.

   |     |     |
   | :-- | --: |
   | To find field "ground_truth", Type "gr" and choose suggestion. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_1.png" width="80%" class="target">|
   | Next type "." |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_2.png" width="80%" class="target">|
   | Next to find person, type "per" and choose suggestion. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_3.png" width="80%" class="target">|
   | When complete query sentences, press Enter. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_4.png" width="80%" class="target">|

3. Query samples by its annotation field with single condition
   
   To query samples with single condition, type query string as below format with corresponding field type:
   |     |     |
   | :-- | --: |
   | **Single Classification**:<br /> `<sample_field>` `<ops>` `<value>`.<br />`ops` in `{=, !=}`. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_5.png" width="80%" class="target">|
   | **Multi-label**:<br /> `<sample_field.class_name>` `<ops>` `0`.<br />`ops` in `{=, >}`. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_6.png" width="80%" class="target">|
   | **Detection/Polygons/Polylines/Keypoints**:<br /> - By number of objects:<br />`<sample_field.count>` `<ops>` `<value>`.<br /> - By specifying class:<br />`<sample_field.class_name>` `<ops>` `<value>`.<br /> `ops` in `{>, >=, <, <=, =, !=}`. |<img src="../_static/img/smart_query_7.png" width="80%" class="target"><img src="../_static/img/smart_query_8.png" width="80%" class="target">|

4. Query samples by its annotation field with multiple conditions 

   To query samples with multiple condition, use AND/OR between query string. Note that query string must be inside round bracket as `( query string )`.

5. Query samples by multiple conditions and extra math operations

   The query string can be flexible by adding math operations in right term in usecase you need.

6. Query samples by metadata 

   Some dataset may have metadata field, we can query sample based on its metadata by type "metadata" in beginning of query string.

7. Query samples by other fields

   In order to query sample by other fields (for example: evaluation metrics), first calculate and input the metric value to Renex dataset. Then type query string with sample field as imported evaluation metric. 
   For example, query samples which have number of true positive larger than 3.
