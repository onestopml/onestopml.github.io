# Dataset Exploration
In a workspace, we can explore the dataset in different ways. 
### Filter by labels
|      |           |
| :--- | :-------: |
| Show only (Select) detections as “person” in the “ground_truth”. Then there are 2,693 images with at least one person specified in the “ground_truth”. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter1.png)|
| Not show (Exclude) detections as “person” in the “ground_truth”. Then there are 4,934 images with at least one person specified in the “ground_truth”. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter2.png)|
| Show 35 images recognized as “ski” with 0.8 <= confidence score <= 0.95. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter3.png)|
| Click the eye icon to show only 1 sample with grayscale tag. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter4.png)|
| Filter by enter ID or filepath string. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter5.png)|
| Click “Sort By Ascending” / “Sort By Descending” to sort samples with the “eval_tp” values in ascending / descending order. Limit the “eval_tp” by changing min, max values on the slider. |![](../_static/img/ds_filter6.png)|


### Smart query
We can filter our dataset by using queries. For more detail, please refer to [smart query user guide](smart_query.html)

### Navigate views
1. Click the bookmark button to apply the filter on the right panel to the current view.

Switching between color by field and by value:

|By field                   |By value                   |
